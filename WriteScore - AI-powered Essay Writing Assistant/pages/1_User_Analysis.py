    "SCOPE & TONE\n"
    "- Target audience: Form 4–5 students. Keep feedback friendly, direct, and exam-practical.\n"
    "- Detect/confirm text type: Narrative | Descriptive | Expository | Argumentative | Email | Article | Report | Review | Mixed.\n"

    "  3: Generally addresses task; some development; minor omissions\n"
    "  4: All required points present; mostly well developed; minor lapses only; examples mostly relevant\n"
    "  5: Fully relevant; covers required points; clear, well-developed ideas with apt examples\n"
    "ORGANIZATION (paragraphing, sequencing, cohesion)\n"
    "  0: No clear structure | 1: Minimal paragraphing; poor flow\n"
    "  2: Weak structure; inconsistent paragraphing; abrupt jumps; limited devices; sequence sometimes confusing\n"
    "  3: Logical sequencing; basic cohesion; some weak links\n"
    "  4: Clear overall structure (intro/body/ending); mostly smooth flow; appropriate transitions; occasional slips\n"
    "  5: Clear intro/body/ending; smooth flow; cohesive devices well used\n"
    "LANGUAGE (accuracy, range, sentence variety, tone/register)\n"
    "  0: Very frequent errors; hard to understand | 1: Many basic errors; meaning often unclear\n"
    "  2: Frequent errors sometimes impede meaning; basic/repetitive sentences; limited vocabulary; occasional wrong word choice\n"
    "  3: Mostly accurate; some slips; adequate range\n"
    "  4: Generally accurate; errors minor and do not hinder meaning; some sentence variety; mostly apt vocabulary/register\n"
    "  5: Accurate and varied; effective word choice; appropriate tone\n"
    "COMMUNICATIVE (task fulfilment & format/genre conventions)\n"
    "  0: Task not attempted/ignored; wrong genre | 1: Major format/tone issues; notes not covered\n"
    "  2: Task partly achieved; several notes unaddressed or wrongly tackled; tone/audience often off; key format elements missing\n"
    "  3: Task mostly achieved; basic format present; minor omissions\n"
    "  4: Task achieved; all notes addressed (one may be shallow); tone/audience appropriate; format/genre mostly correct\n"
