2) Hospital Management System Using Java Programming Language
System that focus on object-oriented programming with several classes: Staff, Doctor, Patient, Medicine, Lab, Facility, and HospitalManagemnet with the GUI by using JavaFX technology

3) Linear Congruences System with Chinese Remainder Theorem
Write a C++ programming to solve a system of linear congruences by applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem by accepting list of three remainders and their respective modulo, outputting the system of congruences to be solved, and outputting the solution of the system in modulo N.

4) Calculation in Statistics and Statistical Analysis for Two Dataset
Have a statistical analysis on two dataset, "Employee" and "Voter" dataset. In addition, there is also some theoretical and calculation questions in statistics for students to enhance the fundamentals of the statistics

5) Database Design on Student Scholarship System
Create and design database system based on the usage of the Microsoft Access for recording the scholarship holders

6) Configuration for the Logical Volume Management (LVM), Storage Quota, and Semaphore Synchornisation 
Perform a series of configurations and operations including installing the Linux OS, managing users, automating scheduled tasks using cron jobs, configuring Logical Volume Management (LVM), setting up and enforcing disk quotas for specific users, and implementing a C program using POSIX threads and semaphores to simulate synchronization between sensor signals, robots, and machines in Linux OS by using VirtualBox

7) Link Listed for Student Record
Implement a linked list system to manage student records, including personal details, exam results, and subject information, by creating nine specific functions for data manipulation and analysis. Students must work with provided structs (Student, Exam, Subject) to perform tasks like filtering, updating records, calculating statistics, and identifying high-achieving students while ensuring error handling and proper memory management.

8) Binary Search Tree for Student Records
Focuses on implementing and manipulating a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage student records, requiring students to develop functions for reading data from a file, traversing the tree, cloning subtrees, and analyzing node levels and paths. Key tasks include displaying student information in ascending/descending order, identifying deepest nodes, printing level-wise nodes, and generating external paths, all while ensuring proper recursion and tree operations.

9) Membership Card Management System
Analyze, design, and model a Membership Card Management System using UML diagrams and project planning tools

10) Machine Learning-Based Cardiovascular Risk Prediction System: Model Development and Comparative Analysis
Develop a cardiovascular risk prediction system using machine learning, where students preprocessed data, trained six models (including Logistic Regression and Random Forest), and identified Logistic Regression as the best-performing model (99% accuracy), demonstrating an end-to-end ML workflow with equal team contributions.

11) World Cuisine Encyclopedia - Front-end Development
Design and develop a mobile-responsive website (6-8 pages) on culinary, travel, or fitness themes using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap, while implementing storage technologies (cookies, localStorage) and RESTful APIs.

12) MIPS Assembly Program and Processor Comparison
Develop a MIPS assembly program implementing three arithmetic and three logical equations with user input and output functionality, demonstrated through pseudocode and flowcharts; and compare MIPS (RISC) and x86 (CISC) processors across instruction sets, registers, and addressing modes, supported by architectural analysis.

13) Cybersecurity Lab: Attacks and Defense
Focus on network scanning, password cracking, and ransomware analysis, demonstrating practical skills with tools like Nmap, Hydra, and Hashcat to exploit vulnerabilities and strengthen defenses. It emphasizes the importance of strong passwords, system updates, and proactive security measures to mitigate cyber threats

14) Discord Usability Analysis: Evaluating UX Design and Proposing Improvements
Evaluates Discord's usability by analyzing its interface design across five key factors—efficiency, effectiveness, learnability, safety, and utility—and proposes targeted improvements like streamlined role settings and customizable shortcuts. It combines hands-on testing with redesign suggestions to enhance user experience while maintaining Discord's core functionality.

15) Router Config and Connectivity
Focus on configuring and troubleshooting network setups using Packet Tracer and GNS3, including tasks like PAT configuration, DHCP implementation, static routing, NAT, and network access control

16) Database System Design for Fast-Food Restaurant Operations
Design a comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) database system for The Foodie restaurant, including ER and EER diagrams, data dictionaries, tables with sample records, and SQL scripts for implementation. Additionally, we developed SQL queries, PL/SQL stored procedures, and functions to manage orders, transactions, payments, and customer interactions efficiently

17) AWS Deployment of the World Cuisine Encyclopedia: Enhancing Scalability and Global Access
Focus on deploy the World Cuisine Encyclopedia website on AWS using services like S3 for hosting, EC2 for compute resources, VPC for security, and Auto Scaling for scalability to ensure global accessibility and performance and propose future enhancements such as integrating RDS for user feedback, Route 53 for domain management, and Cognito for authentication to further improve the platform.

18) Analysing Global Renewable Energy Trends: Infrastructure, Investment, and Workforce Challenges
Analyse global renewable energy trends using a Kaggle dataset, focusing on infrastructure gaps, investment disparities, and workforce challenges, and provided actionable recommendations to address these issues and create visualizations and an infographic to highlight key findings and support data-driven decision-making for policymakers and stakeholders

19) Designing a Business Information System for Supply Chain with AI: Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting
Design an AI-powered supply chain management system with four core modules (personalized recommendations, data integration, supplier/procurement management, and data security) using design patterns like Observer, Mediator, and Singleton to ensure scalability and real-time responsiveness. The system architecture was validated through component diagrams, class diagrams, and deployment diagrams, with reflections highlighting how design patterns improved modularity and maintainability.

20) Cancer Trends in Elderly Populations: A 2019 Global Study
Analyse global cancer statistics for adults over 75 in 2019, examining incidence trends by gender, region, and cancer type using descriptive statistics and visualizations like pie charts and comparative graphs. All of the findings highlighted key epidemiological patterns, comorbidities in elderly patients, and regional disparities, with individual contributions proposing expanded discussions on risk factors and treatment strategies
